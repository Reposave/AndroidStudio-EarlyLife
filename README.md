# AndroidStudio-EarlyLife
This was a project uploaded on gitlab but is now inaccessible. It's an app that works with an Arduino and was meant to be an IoT toy. 

A video demo is available here: https://youtu.be/OhxExuaC7d4 but if you want to test it yourself, all you need to do is build the project in Android Studio then run it on your emulator
or android device. Some features may not be available as they require an Arduino.
